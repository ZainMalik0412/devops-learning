## 📚 About This Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository documenting my pathway to becoming a DevOps engineer! This is my personal learning space where I track progress, store notes, scripts, projects, and resources as I dive deeper into the DevOps world. This repo serves as my digital notebook and portfolio, constantly evolving as I expand my knowledge. Here you'll find organised notes, code snippets, configurations, and hands on projects that showcase my learning journey.

## 🎯 Learning Focus Areas

### 🐧 **Linux**
Mastering the Linux operating system, including system administration, file management, and command line proficiency.

### 📜 **Bash Scripting**
Writing automation scripts to streamline tasks and enhance command line productivity.

### 🔄 **Version Control (Git)**
Mastering Git workflows for code management, collaboration, and project organisation.

### 🌐 **Networking**
Understanding how systems communicate from TCP/IP fundamentals to DNS, routing, and firewall configurations.

### 📦 **Containerisation & Orchestration**
- **Docker**: Containerising applications for consistency and portability
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestrating containers for scalable, distributed systems

### ☁️ **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**
Exploring cloud services to build, deploy, and scale robust cloud solutions.

### 🏗️ **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)**
Learning to provision and manage cloud resources programmatically with version-controlled infrastructure.

### 🔄 Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
